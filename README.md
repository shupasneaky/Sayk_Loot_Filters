# Sayk_Loot_Filters
Normal Filter - Shows a lot for early league. recommmended for everyone to start with.

SemiStrict filter is the all-rounder, I use this one mainly unless i'm mf;ing or doing some deep delving. really nice for showing some of the more common currency without letting them get in your face.

Scrit Filter - Doesn't show scrolls or armour scraps, shows only best rare bases. Restrictive but managable. When you press Alt (to show items not regularly shown) the filter will show everything that would have been shown with Normal Filter

UberStrict - Absurdly restrictive, only MF'ers and XP farmers should use this. When you press Alt (to show items not regularly shown) the filter will show everything that would have been shown with Strict Filter

Hi, my name is Sayk, i'm a long time POE player and lootfilter maker. I normally make loot filters for myself, but my friends asked me to make a filter for them, and they liked it; so i'm sharing it with everyone.
This filter does not include chaos recipe. 
It's meant for players who grind and don't want to waste time picking up stuff that will never sell.
It's easily customizable by using Notepad++ with the provided code language.
It includes descriptions of each section. and preset blocks for easy hiding or showing.

I update my filter every league based on hardcore trade league meta-game.

A quick note: Because the filter is down to personal preference, I've chosen to create a Notepad++ language to edit my filter and all it's oddities. I have made a short video explaining how to install and use this filter language. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn76UQ2XZJ8&feature=youtu.be

The filter is separated into 3 categories
Regular, Strict, and Uber Strict; I create a specific filters that have funny sounds from old movies and streamers that I use myself, if you want to use that one you can find it on my github, and a video of how to install it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkMuGpkgIpk&feature=youtu.be

I've also included a link to my CAPSTONE project that I will be creating a piece of code for that prices items based on their value of affixes and probability of occuring. this is an ongoing project that may take until 2022 to complete.

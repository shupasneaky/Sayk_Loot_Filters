# Sayk_Loot_Filters
Normal Filter - Shows a lot for early league. recommmended for everyone to start with.

Scrit Filter - Doesn't show scrolls or armour scraps, shows only best rare bases. Restrictive but managable. The filter I use.

UberStrict - Absurdly restrictive, only MF'ers and XP farmers should use this.

Hi, my name is Sayk, i'm a long time POE player and lootfilter maker. I normally make loot filters for myself, but my friends asked me to make a filter for them, and they liked it; so i'm sharing it with everyone.
This filter does not include chaos recipe. 
It's meant for players who grind and don't want to waste time picking up stuff that will never sell.
It's easily customizable by using Notepad++ with the provided code language.
It includes descriptions of each section. and preset blocks for easy hiding or showing.

I update my filter every league based on hardcore trade league meta-game.

If you have any questions feel free to message me in-game on the poe website at https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/shupasneaky
